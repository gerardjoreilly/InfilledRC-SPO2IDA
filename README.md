# Extended SPO2IDA for Infilled RC Frames

SPO2IDA has emerged as a convenient tool for the assessment of structures. It relates a structure’s backbone characteristics to a set of incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) curves using static pushover analysis (SPO) results and a library of empirical fitting coefficients for the different branches of the idealised SPO backbone. It permits the quantification of structural performance up to structural collapse as a function of seismic intensity in a simple and efficient manner.

It has been developed mainly for ductile structures that can be sufficiently represented via a SPO backbone with a certain ductile post-yield hardening followed by a post-peak degradation. This behaviour is quite representative of ductile RC and steel moment-resisting frames and has resulted in the tool being widely adopted.

A new library of empirical coefficients have been fitted and proposed by considering a large database of representative backbones to result in an extended SPO2IDA proposal for infilled RC frames.
